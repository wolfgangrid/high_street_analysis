## Closures of Shops and Restaurants during the Corona Virus Pandemic

This project aims to document the temporary and permanent closures of shops and restaurants over the course of the Corona virus pandemic.
To do so we are collecting data from major cities in Europe and in the US.

## Some observations:

Shops shut temporarily at a higher rate during the different lockdowns than restaurants did but permanent closures have affected restaurants at higher rates:

The relative number of temporary closures and permanent closures may be quite different within a city. Stockholm had much fewer temporary closures than other European capitals but a comparable rate of permanent closures.
